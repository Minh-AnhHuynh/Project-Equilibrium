I have started this blog, following the spirit of Alexey Guzey's [advice
about why you should start writing a
blog.](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#why-unoriginal-writing-is-useful)
Thoughts are made to be shared, and writing down your thoughts is the
ultimate form of thinking, as you have to deal with conveying clear,
intelligible, thoughts that make sense, as well as making you remember
in the long run the concepts you thought about, due to how you had to
previously tinker with them in your brain, thus forming connections. The
only issue is that making a blog is daunting, but not so anymore.
