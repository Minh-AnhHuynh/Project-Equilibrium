This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

![](thumbnail.jpg)

Well, making a website in quarto is surprisingly easy, I highly
recommend it to anyone, as a fresh beginner knowing only R and R
markdown ! As Quarto is a supersed version of R Markdown, it will
eventually find its footings among the community. It's already very
promising, having adopted the legacy and learnings of R markdown, all in
a package. I think a lot people should give it a try.

I intend to use this blog as either a bioinformatics blog of various
topics, most likely useful stuff I have found while coding.
